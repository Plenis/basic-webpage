            <p> I chose Dubai firstly because it has the lowest or 0% crime rate, and I personally am not a fan of all
                of
                that.
                Dubai is such a beautiful and elegant place and I'm imagining peaceful as well.
                There are many beautiful places that I can go to and many adventurous things that I can do as well.
                Dubai is
                famous for sightseeing attractions such as the Burj Khalifa (the world's tallest building) and shopping
                malls that come complete with mammoth aquariums and indoor ski slopes. </p>
